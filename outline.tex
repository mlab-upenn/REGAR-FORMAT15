\section{outline}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduction
	\subitem The problem of closed-loop formal verification
	\subitem In this paper, we illustrate four challenges and solve them for medical devices, specifically cardiac devices. 
	\subitem Some elements of the proposed method can be generalized and have a wider applicability: namely the abstraction tree and MC on the tree (abstractness measure, search procedure)
	\subitem Give overview of method in a block diagram and briefly explain it in text.
	
	\item Formal models of the environment
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Heart basics, enough to understand the proposed models
		\item Emphasis: different heart conditions necessitate different models.
		\item Creation of formal heart models: graph structure + node and path automata
		\item Two examples of heart conditions and their formal models.
		\item Emphasis: our initial set of models is not necessarily complete. That is, there are more heart conditions that could be modeled, but aren't. It is always a work in progress.	
		\subitem Therefore we want to add behavior to try and cover things not covered by the models. Adding models i not the answer since it will always be an incomplete set. Not to mention it's a manual process.
		\item Formalization of physiological requirements
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Abstraction rules: how to add behavior to the initial set of models
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Why predicate-based abstraction can be inadequate?
		\label{ar:inadequate}
		\subitem If we get a cex which is spurious by the classical definition, it is not necessarily spurious physiologically. Remember we are enriching the behavior precisely to cover new conditions.
		\subitem So it's up to the physician to decide if the cex is spurious or not. But predicate-based abstraction might give hard-to-understand cex.
%		\subsubitem Two ambiguities: interaction and context ambiguities. Interaction ambiguity because the requirement is purely on the env.
		\subitem Example
		\subitem Therefore, need the added behavior to be physiologically meaningful so it's understandable.
		\item Physiologically meaningful abstraction rules
		\subitem Give formal definition of a rule as a graph-to-graph function $R: G \rightarrow G'$ 
		\subitem Why do you call it abstraction? 
		\subitem Given 2 concrete examples (more in tech report)
		\item Example of rule application.
		\item Abstraction tree		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Model-checking with the abstraction tree
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Measure of abstractness; define 'appropriate for the requirement'
		\item Search procedure
		\item What happens if a counter-example is found: give the physician the most concrete model on which the cex still shows up.
		\item Case study: i.e., elaborate example
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Conclusions and future research
	
\end{enumerate}
