\subsection{Rule 5: Merge Self-activation Nodes with Interaction Nodes}
%\todo[inline]{not clear}
The effect of self-activation nodes on the interaction of the pacemaker is triggering sensing events within certain delay. In this rule we merge all the self-activation nodes to their neariest interaction nodes. If there exists multiple self-activation nodes merging to the same interaction node, the parameters of the new model are determined following Rule 3.
