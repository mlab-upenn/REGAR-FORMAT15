\section{Formal models of the environment}
\label{formalModelsofEnv}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Heart basics, enough to understand the proposed models
	\item Emphasis: different heart conditions necessitate different models.
	\item Creation of formal heart models: graph structure + node and path automata
	\item Two examples of heart conditions and their formal models.
	\item Emphasis: our initial set of models is not necessarily complete. That is, there are more heart conditions that could be modeled, but aren't. It is always a work in progress.		
	\item Formalization of physiological requirements
\end{enumerate}
