\section{Formal models of the environment}
\label{formalModelsofEnv}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Heart basics, enough to understand the proposed models
	\item Emphasis: different heart conditions necessitate different models.
	\item Creation of formal heart models: graph structure + node and path automata
	\item Two examples of heart conditions and their formal models.
	\item Emphasis: our initial set of models is not necessarily complete. That is, there are more heart conditions that could be modeled, but aren't. It is always a work in progress.		
	\item Formalization of physiological requirements
\end{enumerate}

In this paper, we re-use the modeling formalism proposed in \cite{VHM_proc}, which was developed based on ElectroPhysiological (EP) principles.
A given human heart condition is modeled by a labeled directed graph: the vertices of the graph represent nodes, or locations, in the heart, while edges represent conduction paths between the nodes. 
\begin{defn}
	[Labeled graph]
	A \textbf{labeled graph} is a directed graph $G = (V,E,A)$ where 
	$V$ is a finite set of vertices, $E \subset V\times V$ is a finite set of directed edges,
	and $A$ is a total labeling function $A: V \cup E \rightarrow TA$
	where $TA$ is the set of parametrized timed automata \cite{timed_automata}.
	The function $A$ labels each vertex with a \emph{node automaton}, and each edge with an \emph{edge automaton}.
	All node (resp. edge) automata share the same structure, and differ only in the values of their parameters.
	The parameters of a timed automaton are variables that appear in the right-hand side of guard and invariant conditions, and whose value can only be changed by a reset that occurs at a transition.
		
	Both node and path automata are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nodepathTA}
\end{defn}


\todo[inline]{"extended" timed automata in what sense?}
\paragraph{Physiological meaning of the formal model.}
A node automaton models the conduction states of heart tissue, and changes therein. 
Its three states correspond to 3 timing periods of the action potential. 
From \textsf{Rest} state, the node can either self-activate or be activated by external stimuli (both events are indicated by Act\_node) and transition to the \textsf{ERP} state. 
In the \textsf{ERP} state the node does not respond to external stimuli because it is refractory. 
In the \textsf{RRP} state, the node can still be activated and transition to the \textsf{ERP} state.
But the fact that the activation arrived early (in the RR Period) affects the ERP and the conduction delay of the tissue.  
This is tracked by a shared variable $C(i)$ for the $i^{th}$ node automaton. \todo[inline]{what is $C$?}
The new ERP period is determined by a function over clock value $g(f(t))$ which mimics the beat-to-beat dynamics described in \cite{josephson}. \todo[inline]{what are $g,f$?}
%
%The electrical conduction through the tissue \emph{between} nodes is abstracted using \emph{path automata}. 
%The path automata are used to represent structural or functional electrical connections between nodes. 
%The initial state of a path automaton is \textsf{Idle}, which corresponds to no conduction. 
%A path has two conduction directions, forward and backward.
%These are represented by the states Ante and Retro, named after their standard physiological terms Antegrade and Retrograde.
%If \textsf{Act\_path} event is received from one of the nodes connected to the path, the a transition to either \textsf{Ante} or \textsf{Retro} state will occur in the path automaton. 
%At the same time the clock invariant of the state is modified according to the shared variable $C(a/b)$. 
%This corresponds to the change of the conduction delay that is caused by early activation. 
%Similarly to a node automaton, the changing trend is extracted from clinical data. 
%
%The parameters of the node and path automata determine the ranges of time in which the automata can stay in corresponding locations. 
%The lower endpoint is specified as a clock invariant and the upper endpoint is specified as a guard. 
%For a heart model $G$ with $n$ nodes and $m$ paths (thus, $n$ vertices and $m$ edges), the node automata are denoted as $N_i, i\in[n]$ and path automata are denoted as $P_j,j\in[m]$. 
%\todo[inline]{change to $V_i$ and $E_i$ to stay consistent with definition of graph?}
%The parameters for the nodes are $Trest$ (with range $[Trest_{min}$),TERP,TRRP and the parameters for the paths are $\{Tante,Tretro\}$.
