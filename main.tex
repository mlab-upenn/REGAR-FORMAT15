% \subsubsection{Domain Knowledge During Abstraction Level Management}
% Although CEGAR is not directly applicable to the environment model, the knowledge of how the environment works can be used during the abstraction level management. 

% The domain knowledge contains:


% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Distinguish environment conditions specified in the requirement
% 	\item Using domain knowledge a counter-example can be regarded as spurious, although sometimes not 100\%. (Physicians can say that some conditions are very unlikely to happen, but not impossible)
% \end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
    
   
%     \item The system and the environment have very different characteristics, thus requires different approaches during modeling.
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item We have full or near-full knowledge of the system:
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item The system has one single deterministic implementation or the non-determinism is minimal
%             \item The internal mechanism of the system is 
%             \item Observability of the system is maximal
%         \end{itemize}
%      	\item
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Model validation}: Given the same input sequence, the model should be able to produce equivalent or close enough output as the corresponding entity being modeled.
            
%     \item System modeling
% \end{itemize}

%Medical device is a typical Cyber-Physical System and ensuring the safety and efficacy of the device requires closed-loop verification. Currently closed-loop verifications of medical devices are performed in the form of clinical trials in which the devices are tested on the patients. Using clinical trials as closed-loop verification has several problems:

% In \cite{VHM_proc} we addressed the problems above by proposing a model-based design framework to enable closed-loop verification earlier in the design stage. The increased confidence in safety and efficacy of the device can potentially reduce the scale of the clinical trials, thus reduce cost.

% In model-based design for Cyber-Physical Systems, both the system and its environment are abstracted as models. One of the widely used abstraction technique is \emph{over-approximation}. The benefits of over-approximation are:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Reducing verification complexity by removing details of the system or the environment.
% 	\item Generalizing different system/environment conditions
% \end{itemize}
% However, there are inevitable infomation losses during over-approximation. The biggest challenge for model-based design is obtaining correct abstraction levels of the models and managing the information loss during the abstraction steps. 

% Although over-approximation
