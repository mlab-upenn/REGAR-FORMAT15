\section{\textcolor{red}{Case 2: Resolving Validity Ambiguities Using Model Refinement}}
\label{resolvingValidityAmbiguities}
\subsection{Atrial Tachycardia and Mode-switch}
\subsection{Requirement Encoding}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pre-condition: Atrial Tachycardia, vent  ricular rate normal
    \item Post-condition: No increase in ventricular rate
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Identify potential ambiguities}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Utilizing the assumptions made during abstraction Rule 3
    \item Replacing ERP with non-deterministic conduction can potentially increase the number of activations
    \item Two possible refined executions
    
\begin{itemize}
	\item Valid 
    \item Invalid
\end{itemize}
    \item Undo Rule 3
    \item Refine to $H_2$
\end{itemize}
