\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a methodology for closed-loop model checking of medical devices, and illustrates it with a case study on implantable pacemakers.
To evaluate the performance of a medical device on the human body, a model of the device's physiological environment must be developed, and the closed loop consisting of device (e.g., pacemaker) and environment (e.g., the human heart) is model-checked.
Formal modeling of the environment and its application in model checking pose several challenges that are addressed in this paper.
Pacemakers should guarantee safe operations within large varieties of heart conditions, which are modeled by a set of timed automata models.
A set of domain-specific abstraction rules are developed that can over-approximate the timing behaviors of a heart model or a group of heart models, such that the new behaviors introduced by abstraction are mostly physiologically meaningful.
The rules serve as a systematic method to cover heart conditions that may not be explicitly accounted for in the initial set of heart models.
Automated applications of the abstraction rules result in an abstraction tree.
Closed-loop model checking is systematically performed using the heart models in the abstraction tree, to obtain the most concrete counter-example(s) correspond to property violation.
These counter-example, along with their physiological context, are then presented to the physician to determine its physiological validity.
The proposed methodology creates a separation between steps requiring physiological domain expertise (model creation and abstraction rules definition) and steps that can be automated (rule application, model checking, and abstraction refinement).
While we illustrate the methodology for pacemaker verification, it is more broadly applicable to the verification of other medical devices.
